# ONS-JavaScript-Template

This repository provides a foundational template for developing JavaScript projects, complete with essential tools and configurations.

This template is designed to help you quickly start new JavaScript projects, allowing you to focus on writing code. It handles the setup of directory structures, tool configurations, and automated testing until you are ready to customise these aspects yourself.

This template is generated using Yeoman, an open-source tool for creating projects from templates. It also supports seamless updates as the template evolves.

For an example built using this template, see this [demo repository]().

## Getting Started

You have two options for generating a project from this template:

1. **Using GitHub Template Feature**: Click [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) on GitHub to create a new repository based on this template directly from the web interface. This method is quick and convenient, however it has limited customisation options compared to local generation.
2. **Running Yeoman Locally**: Use Yeoman on your local machine to tailor the template to your specific requirements. This approach allows for greater customisation according to your project's needs and will automatically set up the repository and branch protection.

## Using GitHub Template Feature

To get started:

1. Click on [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Name your new repository and provide a description, then click *Create repository*. *Note: The repository name should be lowercase and use hyphens (-) instead of underscores*.
3. GitHub will now copy the contents over, and GitHub Actions will process the template and commit to your new repository shortly after you click *Create repository*.
4. Wait until the *Rename Project from Template* job in GitHub Actions finishes running!
5. Once the *Rename Project from Template* action has run, you can clone your new repository and start working on your project.

**Known Limitations**: Some GitHub Actions workflows may fail on the initial run post-clone because the repository will not be fully configured until the *Rename Project from Template* job has completed. This is expected behaviour and can be safely ignored. Subsequent runs will not encounter this issue.

##  Running Yeoman Locally

Prerequisites:
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Sanjeev to add the tech part

1. Operating System: Ubuntu/MacOS.
2. Git: Ensure Git is installed and configured.
3. GitHub CLI (OPTIONAL): If you want to automate repository creation and configuration, including branch protection, ensure the GitHub CLI is installed and you are authenticated.

## Generate Project from Template

Yeoman will prompt you with a series of questions to customise the project according to your needs. Once you have answered all the questions, Yeoman will generate the project for you.

To initiate the project generation, run:
